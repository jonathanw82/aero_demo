# Aeroponic root zone demonstaighter

To advance a critical project for the RHS Chelsea Flower Show, I developed the control software for a horticultural demo stand, designed and built by James Fallath. My firmware solution specifically addressed the need for precise lighting and atomiser timing control. I engineered the system to allow a latched button to govern the atomiser's operation at predetermined intervals, sustaining plant life within the display. I also implemented a momentary button that activated root zone LEDs, enabling clear visualization of mist and root conditions, a core requirement for the demonstration. My direct contribution helped ensure the project's success for such a high-profile event.
